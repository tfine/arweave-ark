# arweave-ark

- A basic implementation of ARK for arweave (Archival Resource Keys: https://n2t.net/e/ark_ids.html)
- if you add the word "question" to end of the url after an arweave tag the add will return any metadata tags labelled who, what, where, when

# TO-DO

- Having problems implementing colon and question marks due to express routing rules, need to figure out
- Need to have a url that looks like http://something.net/ark:/Mix5mpHUB9eq7b5WUI1esAmJ6J_lD6Xmps28Zb40HyE/?
- Perhaps use regular expressions?
